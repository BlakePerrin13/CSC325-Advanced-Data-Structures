# CSC325-Advanced-Data-Structures

> This repository contains the programs for the course CSC325 Advanced Data Structures.

## Introduction

This course is an introduction to advanced data structures. The course covers the following topics:

- Computational complexity
- Sets and maps
- Trees
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Pattern matching algorithms
- NP-complete problems

## Programs

The programs are written in python and are run on the command line. The programs are as follows:

- [Program 0](Program0%20-%20Python%20Again/): This program is designed to create a linked list with a size specified by the user. The program outputs the original list along with the head and tail data, and then sorts the data using the selection sort. The new head and tail data is then outputted to the user.

### Program0 Usage

```bash
python3 Program0.py
```

- [Program 1](Program1%20-%20Sudoku%20Puzzle/): This program is designed to solve a sudoku puzzle by using the rules of the game. The program will take in a matrix of numbers and then use the rules to solve the puzzle. The program will output the original matrix and the matrix after the puzzle has been solved.

### Program1 Usage

```bash
python3 sudoku.py <unsolved_puzzle.txt>
```

- [Program 2](Program2%20-%20AVL%20Trees/): This program is designed to create a the AVL tree data structure. The program will take in a list of numbers and then create a tree from the list. The program will output the original list, the AVL tree, the in-order traversal of the tree, and the leaves of the tree.

### Program2 Usage

```bash
python3 avl_template.py <node_list.txt>
```
