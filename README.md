# CSC325-Advanced-Data-Structures

> This repository contains the programs for the course CSC325 Advanced Data Structures.

## Introduction

This course is an introduction to advanced data structures. The course covers the following topics:

- Computational complexity
- Sets and maps
- Trees
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Pattern matching algorithms
- NP-complete problems

## Programs

The programs are written in python and are run on the command line. The programs are as follows:

- [Program 0](Program0%20-%20Python%20Again/Program0.py): This program is designed to create a linked list with a size specified by the user. The program outputs the original list along with the head and tail data, and then sorts the data using the selection sort. The new head and tail data is then outputted to the user.
